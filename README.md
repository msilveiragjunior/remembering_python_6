## 📘 Overview

Every year, I revisit the **foundations of Python** through hands-on exercises and small, focused projects.  
This repository exists for that purpose — to rebuild fluency from the **basics to the intermediate level**.

The material in this repo follows the book  
_**Python Crash Course**_ by **Eric Matthes**,  
serving as a **concise synthesis** of its key ideas and examples.

> 🧠 The goal: to internalize Python’s core logic by re-implementing and summarizing its essential patterns and principles.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project is not a reproduction of the book’s content,  
but a **personal synthesis and reinterpretation** of it —  
written to reinforce understanding through **active practice**.

**Objectives:**
- Revisit and strengthen the **fundamentals of Python**  
- Practice **problem solving and structured thinking**  
- Document concepts in a **concise and accessible** way  
- Provide a **reference** for learners following a similar path

## 🧩 Learning Approach

1. Recreate and adapt examples from _Python Crash Course_ in my own words and style.  
2. Focus on **clarity** and **conciseness**, explaining each concept practically.  
3. Build a **solid foundation** before moving to data analysis and engineering topics.  
4. Keep the repository **modular**, with each script self-contained and well-documented.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Python 3.11+**
- **VSCode / Jupyter** (optional for interactive examples)
- **Standard Library only** — focusing purely on Python fundamentals

## 🧭 Educational Philosophy

This repository reflects an **active recall** approach:  
learning by **rebuilding and explaining** rather than just reading.  

Each example is intentionally simple but structured,  
designed to emphasize **clarity, syntax, and logic flow** —  
skills that form the backbone of data engineering and analysis later on.
