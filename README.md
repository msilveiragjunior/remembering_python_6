Every years I remember the foundations of python by doing basic exercises and solving basic problems. This is a repository just for that. From the basics to the intermediary.
So I will cover the book Python Crash Course from the beggining to the end. I found that to be the best way to remember the basics and write, in a concise way, the content inside it.
All of the content of this repo is a synthesis of the Python Crash Course book by Eric Mathes. So all credits to him. All I'm doing is synthesizing the content of the book for personal purposes.
