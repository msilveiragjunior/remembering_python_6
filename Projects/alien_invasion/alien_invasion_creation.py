# --- Alien Invasion project from the book --- #
# Lets follow Eric Matthes book to create the project
# alien invasion. For that, we'll have to install
# pygame to windows
# To do that, we'll have to execute pip install pygame
# inside the windows terminal

# Lets follow Eric Matthes book, python crash course.
# We'll create alien_invasion.py file; with this first
# file we'll create an empty window so the module
# pygame can execute

# Now that we've created the game screen, we can modify
# the background color, following the book.

# Now lets create a class with configurations for the program.
# By doing this, we'll make the program cleaner and organized.
# Lets call it settings.py

# Following the Python Crash Course book, we'll now add the image
# of the spaceship to our game. We'll load it and use the method
# blot() from pygame to draw it.

# Lets create the class ship, so it will hold and load and draw
# the image of the ship.
# We'll call it ship.py, the same name the book uses

# Lets update the alien_invasion file and draw the ship,
# from the ship class inside ship.py file, inside it.
